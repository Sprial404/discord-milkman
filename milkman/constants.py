    There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack. These orbital images tell me that the hostile numbers have gone from a few hundred,
    to well over two thousand in one day. And more are pourin' in. In a week's time there could be 20,000 of 'em. At that point they will overrun our perimeter.
    That's not gonna happen. Our only security lies in preemptive attack. We will fight terror with terror.
    The hostiles believe that this mountain territory is protected by their... deity. And when we destroy it, we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep,
    that they won't come within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again. And that, too, is a fact.
